# DEEL BACKEND TASK SOLUTIONS

For the solution I first resolved the desired routes without any particular 
improvement. I focused on getting inputs and outpus right.

# Improved Version of Solution

For the improved version I decided to approach the problem using a different architecture called "Hexagonal Architecture" or "ports and adapters".

I could not finish this implementation on the 3 hour window but I created placeholders to show the work I was doing.


## Folder Structure:

src:
    Adapters:
        input: // Anything that drives the app. Example, REST API made in express:
            Rest:
        output: // DB Outputs of the app
            db:
                // sequelize configs here
                // db initializations here
            repositories:
                // This is the data access layer (DAL)
                // repositories use input port interface to define available methods
    Ports:
        input:
            // Interface that define methods used in business logic apps
        output:
            // Interface that define methods used in output adapters like DAL
    Core: // All business logic goes here
        Apps: // business logic is separated by domain apps
            API:
                // for simplicuty I created an API app only, but domain can be divided between jobs, contracts, profiles, etc.
    
    main.ts // Here we inizialize adapters: StartExpreesServer, initilze db, seed DB.
Tests:
    integration:
        // API REST integration tests shold go here
    unit:
        // Unit tests
        Model and repository functions, among other parts, should be tested here
    e2e:
        // entire flows shold be tested here
